Hi, I'm **Ege Yuceel**, a **second-year Ph.D. student in the [Reliable Autonomy Group](https://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/)** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, advised by [Prof. Sayan Mitra](https://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/). 

My research interests broadly lie in robotics, particularly in exploring the **robust and agile limits of vision-based control**. I am also interested in developing **planning and localization algorithms** that have soundness and completeness guarantees in minimal-information settings, with applications to safe autonomy, reach-avoid planning, and vision-guided control.

Previously, I completed my **B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering** at **Bilkent University**, where I worked with [Dr. Muhammed Ömer Sayın](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/sayin/) in the [Games, Decisions, and Networks Lab](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/). My undergraduate research focused on **multi-agent learning** and **game theory**.
