Hi, I'm Ege! I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University. At Bilkent, my research spanned algorithmic game theory, multi-agent learning, and reinforcement learning under the guidance of [Dr. Muhammed Sayın](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/sayin/) in the [Games, Decisions, and Networks Lab](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/).

Now, I am working on synthesizing theoretically provable, optimal controllers for autonomous systems operating under partial information while ensuring they meet hard safety constraints under the guidance of Prof. Sayan Mitra at UIUC.


## 📰 News

- 🎉 Exciting announcement! I am starting my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am honored to work under the guidance of Prof. Sayan Mitra.
- 🎉 Exciting news! Our paper "Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach" has been accepted for publication in the prestigious **IEEE Control Systems Letters (IEEE L-CSS)**!
- We are delighted to share that the revised version of our preprint '[Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906)' is now available on arXiv! This updated version expands our original research to cover multiplayer game settings. In this iteration, we extend our methodology to scenarios where N-type agents define the game state while A-type agents compete. You can access the updated preprint at arXiv:2403.08906.
- Our latest preprint, co-authored with Yüksel Arslantaş and Muhammed Ömer Sayın, is now available on arXiv! Titled '[Strategizing against Q-learners: A Control-theoretical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08906)', you can read it at arXiv:2403.08906.
- Dr. Sayın recently presented our findings on "Convergence of Heterogeneous Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic Games" at the CDC Workshop 2023 on "[Control, Game, and Learning Theory for Security and Privacy](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/cdc2023workshop/home?authuser=0)".
- We are excited to announce that our newest preprint, co-authored with Yüksel Arslantaş, Yiğit Yalın, and Muhammed Ömer Sayın, is now live on arXiv! The paper, titled '[Convergence of Heterogeneous Learning Dynamics in Zero-sum Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00778)', is available for you to read at arXiv:2311.00778.
- Dr. Sayın delivered an invited talk on “Convergent Heterogeneous Learning for Zero-sum Stochastic Games” at the [Annual Allerton Conference](https://allerton.csl.illinois.edu/), sharing insights from our ongoing research in this domain.
